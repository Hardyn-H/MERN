               <div><article>The humble burger has been a staple of our diet since the late 19th century,<br>starting life as a high society dish, that was one of the most expensive out there to morphing into convenience food.<br> Today it is enjoyed by millions daily and can be described as the most successful American export.<br>My intention is for this blog to chart my journey as I explore this most diverse of food types,<br> travelling around to find the greatest that there is to offer, from the humble to the mighty.

               <br> Along the way I plan on bringing you my own experiments in burger recipes so that you can try them for yourself, <br>and explore the taste sensations that can be offered between sliced buns.</article>

                <div><article>As we delve deeper and deeper into the underbelly of the burger-beast we will uncover the history of the burger,<br> and try to replicate its past iterations offering a view into the culinary fog of time.
                 <br>   We also want to showcase the restaurants that you feel deserve a place in the Burger Hall of fame, <br> so if you know if a place that smashed it time after time, feel free to send in your recommendations.                  
                    <br>The aim of this blog is to be a place for all to come and celebrate the burger for all its finery,<br> helping to cement its place in your heart as the go to food for all occasions
